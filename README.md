# orcpub

This is the code for OrcPub2.com. Many, many people have expressed interest in helping out or checking out the code, so I have decided to make that possible by open sourcing it.

## FAQs
**Q: Ummmmm, why is your code so ugly, I thought Clojure code was supposed to be pretty.** 

**A:** *Yeah, about that...I worked on this for about 4 months full time, trying to compete with D&D Beyond's huge team and budget. That lead to a stressed-out me and ugly code. Help me make it pretty sucka!*


**Q: Mwahahahaha, now that I have your code I'm going to fork it and build the most awesome website in the world that will totally fucking annihilate OrcPub2.com. I'm going to call it FlumphTavern69.com. Come at me bro!**

**A:** *Motherfucking hell yeah, do that shit, flumphs are some sexy bitches!*


**Q: Blahahahaha, you done fucked up, we are super-mega-corp Hex Inc. we will steal your awesome code and put it into our less awesome app. What you got to say about that, huh, bitch?**

**A:** *I'm down for that shit, your app makes me sad, if you were to combine your official license and professional visual design with my more modern technical and UX design, your app would make me happy and I could justify paying all the money for all the content* 


**Q: Seriously?!!! Your unit test coverage is pathetic!**

**A:** *Yep, add some, it would be rad.*


**Q: I'm a newb Clojure developer looking to get my feet wet, where to start?**

**A:** *First I would start by getting the fundamentals down at http://www.4clojure.com/, then maybe getting your bearing by checking out my more gentle (and clean) introduction to the OrcPub stack: https://github.com/larrychristensen/messenjer, which I walkthrough on https://lambdastew.com. From there you might add some unit tests or pick up an open issue on the "Issues" tab (and add unit tests with it).*
