To have your homebrew orcbrew file automatically loaded when a new client connects place it here with the name "homebrew.orcbrew".
This will elect to not import the homebrew if any other homebrew has already been imported.
If you want to overwrite what is already loaded delete all of the content from the Content List section and reload the page.
